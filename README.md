# firstBackbone
My first backbone app

By using json data of cricket world cup 2015 I made an app using Backbone.js and used Django as local hosting server.
This is my first web app in backbone.js. I used Handlebar.js for  compiling template in backbone. This app will give you the cricket world cup 2015 fixtures, participating teams and the GMT timings of the matches.
